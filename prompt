"Currently my code works well. It connects to my node and gives me the 
information i asked for. 'main.py' will get three pieces of data which are
'chain', 'blocks' and 'bestblockhash'. I want you to modify the 'coreQuery.py'
file to ask for the data you need to create a front end solution to what 'main.py'
will produce when ran. I have an example of exactly the template id like you to use
to complete the front end already. The 'memePoolGUI.html' will need to be compatible
 with the 'main.py' file. The 'main.py' file will need to be compatible with the 
 'coreQuery.py' file. Lastly the 'commands.md' file should give you all the access 
 syntax necessary for modifying 'coreQuery.py'. I dont want any changes dont to how 
 the memePoolGUI.html will look in style and class. I just want you to modify how it
  recieves data. That data should be all set to go from my already working rpc. You 
  have everything you need in this folder to complete the job and there should be no
   reason why anything doesnt work."
